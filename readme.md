PROGRAM OVERVIEW
----------------
	
KnightReader is a RSS feed reader that allows users to subscribe to and manage their favorite feeds.  KnightReaderApp makes use of the MVC design pattern, in which a Model class contains the feed and folder data, the View Class displays the feeds to the user in a clear way and offers various options to the user, and the Controller class responds to the user input.

The Architecture of the program can be seen at <b>Docs/proposal.pdf</b>.

HOW TO
------

* To run KnightReader, run the Java application KnightReaderApp, which can be found in src/core/ directory.
	
* Once running, you can click on the Subscribe, New Folder, and Refresh All buttons to add, organize, or update your feeds.
	
* You can also use the File, Edit, and About Menus to access these features, in addtion to deleting feeds and folders and renaming folders.
	
* (If you are subscribed any) click on a feed in the left pane to display the feed's entries in the main panel, then click on an entry title to view it.
	
* If a feed (in the left panel) is chosen you can use the search bar to find feed entries whose titles contain specific words.
	
* To exit the program, choose File>Exit (do not use control-Q or quit from the apple menu).
